## Usage

### Usage Requirements
TODO - No packaged version yet as it's not tested.

## Development

### Development Requirements
The code is written in dotnet core 2.0 and so you'll need the (SDK)[https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows] and an editor 
appropriate for developing. I recommend Visual Studio 2017 although Visual Studio Code is a suitable alternative.

### Testing
TODO - No unit tests or integration tests present yet.
